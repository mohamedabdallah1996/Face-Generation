# Face-Generation

In this project, you'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces using 2 datasets: MNIST, CelebA
Since the celebA dataset is complex, we want you to test your neural network on MNIST before CelebA. Running the GANs on MNIST will allow us to see how well our model trains sooner.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Firstly, you must know the basics of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in order to understand this project.
